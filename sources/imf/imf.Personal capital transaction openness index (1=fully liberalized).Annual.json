It includes transactions involving property to which the promise of a return to the owner with payments of interest is attached (e.g., loans or settlements of debt in their country of origin by immigrants) and transfers effected free of charge to the beneficiary (for example, gifts and endowments, loans, inheritances and legacies, and emigrants' assets). The index does not have sub- components. (1=fully liberalized).",
